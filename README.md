# It time to SAVE THE OCEAN! üê≥
 
 This playground aims to transmit a message to protect our ocean in the world.
 
 # My Story
 
 My own project for the WWDC 2022 Student Swift Challenge is Save the Ocean. For a long time, the sea and ocean have had a special place in my heart. I used to go to the beach with my friends, sit and watch the sunset, and eat barbecue there throughout my childhood. The sea and ocean were significantly different a decade ago than they are now. The ocean was clean, and fish and other sea creatures coexisted peacefully with people. The water has been considerably polluted in recent years, and certain aquatic animals are on the edge of extinction. Witnessing such things makes me very sad as someone who is attached to the sea. Because of that reason, I choose my topic in my playground app to be related to the ocean. 
 
## Enjoy and Have Fun ü•≥
 
Nice to see you today. I hope this help you to understand the important of sea to our life.
